# 🧠 JavaScript Core Concepts Practice

This repository contains my **personal practice files** from when I was learning the fundamentals of JavaScript — everything from basic syntax to interactive DOM manipulation and small browser games.

I’m uploading it now as a **throwback to my JS journey**, and maybe it can help others starting out too.
